**NOTE**: I created this program when lego.com used to sell bricks for $0.08/stud CAD in 16 different colours, but I can't find this anymore.
Also, this program does not have a UI, so you'll need to use a command prompt or terminal to run it.

### How to use:
Download the **Python 3** programming language from [python.org](python.org):\
https://www.pythontutorial.net/getting-started/install-python/

Make sure to install the following dependencies first that this program needs to function. Open a command prompt or terminal:
```
pip install colormath
pip install requests
pip install opencv-python
```

After downloading this repository, run `LEGO Art.py` the program by double clicking on the file:\

**Follow the instructions on the program.** It will ask you to enter some values like the path to the image file you want to convert, e.t.c.
